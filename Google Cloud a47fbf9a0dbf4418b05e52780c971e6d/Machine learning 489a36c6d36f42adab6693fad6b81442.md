Using data to **answer** questions.

**Using Data** **answer questions** - Traning Predections

The question answering system we build is called a **MODEL** and this model is created via a process called training.

- In machine learning the goal of training is to create an accurate model that answers our questions correctly most of the time.
- In order to train a model we need to collect the data to train on.

**Important**

- The quality and quantity of data that you gather will directly determine how good your predictive model can be.
- we split the data in two parts where it’s can be :
    - [ ]  training
    - [ ]  evaluation
    -

# Tensorflow

Tenserflow is google’s open source machine learning library. Tenserflow has large API surface.We are looking just high level APIs called **estimators**.

Estimators package up loop for us so that we can train a model by configuring it rather than coding it by hand. This takes away much of the boilerplate, allowing us to think at a higher higher level abstraction.
